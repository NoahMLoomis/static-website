    <img src="./images/Bungee.jpg" width="374" height="372" class="img" alt="Bungee">
    <p>Our bungee jump is the highest in north America, at 201 feet! Though beleived to be less XTREME than our skydiving, we promise that it's just as nerve-raking and fun! Our jump site is located just a 30 minute drive from Montreal, and is a great way to start your day!
    <h3><a href="bookings.html">Skydiving</a></h3>
    <p>Located at the Gatineau Airport, our plane will take you all the way up to 30,000 feet before it's time to jump! The Freefall will last roughly 30 seconds before your parachute will be pulled, and you'll be guided smoothly to the landing zone by one of our <a href="./crew.html"> Skydiving instructor</a> who you'll be straped to.</p>
